* Program:
*    Lab Threads - doIOjobs
*    Brother Jones, CS 345
* Author:
*    Brother Jones with pieces of code from BYU-Idaho Students 
* Summary:
*    This program simulates completing a bunch of IO jobs that need to
*    be done.  Instead of doing actual IO, sleeps are done instead.
*    This program is given one argument that tells how many threads to 
*    use in getting the IO jobs done.
